# Module-8-Journal


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
 
  The problem that we needed to solve in this course varied in application, however, the main concept remained the same; we needed to sort lists of data (typically CSV files) and allow a user to access that data in a way that allowed for repeatable and clean access. We used various algorithms and data structures to accomplish these goals. 
  
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  I learned to plan out the execution of my code prior to starting to write it. This helped me to not only know the technicalities of the code (structures to be used and best methids to use), but it also allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the application being built, meaning I had a better visualization of what I was creating and how I wanted it to behave before I even stratrd to write it. 
  I also had to consider what data structure would accomplish my goal in the best way possible. There are many different types of data structures and these are all important to us becasue each one has various applications and excels in one instance over the other. These data structures are also very important to us because they allow other people looking at our code to anticipate what how the code should act and how to work out bugs with it. 
  
  
  How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  The one major roadblock that I ran into during this project was fully understanding what the data structures themselved should look like and how they should act, however, once I saw some videos on them it all started to click for me. I used a lot of videos on youtube and read many questions and answers on "stackoverflow.com". These questions and answers tended to be far more in depth than was needed for my research, however, this allowed me to gain a far deeper understanding of the concepts being used in my application. 
  
  
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  
  I learned that although I still tend to do better problem solving on the fly (fixing bugs and making changes to the code/program as I go along), I still fell back on my pseudocode and drawings of the program and the various data structures and code structures that I wanted to use. I see myself spending more time on the planning phase in the future rather than coding as I go. I also found out why compiling and running as you go is vital to efficient coding and program creation. 
  
  How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
  Again, going forward I definitely am going to spend more time planning out the program. I certainly could improve my program by making it a little more readable (changing var names, function names, imporiving whitespace use, and inserting a few block comments to better describe what is happening). I also probably could have found ways to #include fewer libraries.
